Simple mod for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes that calls configurable endpoints when the bomb receives a strike, blows up, or is defused.

Perfect for something like... connecting it to a shock collar and inflicting pain on the individual(s) that weren't good enough at the game to defuse the bomb.
